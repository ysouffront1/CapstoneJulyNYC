# Predicting Cardiovascular Disease Risk Through the Use of Unsupervised Machine Learning

Problem Area: According to the CDC, Heart Disease is the leading cause of death for men, women, and a majority of ethnic groups (Hispanic, Black, etc). This project aims to develop and evaluate predictive models that identify key risk factors for cardiovascular disease. 

The User: Determining the factors that can cause Heart Disease can lead to prevention and a decrease in death from Heart Disease, not only in the United States but also in other countries. The benefit of this project would lead one step further in decreasing the large number of deaths from a preventable disease.

The Big Idea: The purpose of the project is to develop a model that will be able to determine whether or not a patient has CVD or is at risk, based on factors such as cholesterol, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, etc. This process will be explored using the CDC NHANES (National Heath and Nutritional Examination Survey) dataset of the year 2013-2014. 

The Impact: By reducing the number of deaths resulting in Cardiovascular disease, businesses can be positively impacted with a healthier workforce, lower healthcare costs, and reduced workersâ€™ compensation claims. The benefits of reducing CVD can be measured by the quantity of money saved from healthcare costs. 

Here is a brief description of each NHANES dataset used in this project:

__Demographic__: holds demographic information of survey partipants

__Questionnaire__: contains basic level information of participant's medical history, physical activity, family-level information, and dietary behavior

__Labs__: includes test of blood or urine samples, cholesterol levels, blood glucose, and other metabolic indicators

__Diet__: provides detailed information on participants' dietary intake

__Examination__: contains physical examination of participants such as bmi, height, waist circumference, blood pressure readings, and other assessments.

__Medication__: contain prescription information, amount of medications used, and how frequent the medications are taken
